<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Siena Forest, and I go to GEMS World Academy Chicago. My intrests include visual arts, songwriting, and dance. I have lived in Chicago my whole life, but I enjoy traveling and exploring new places. I am currently enrolled in the School of Rock preformance program for guitar and vocals. I spend every Monday, Tudesday, and Thursday in private music lessons or group music work. The upcoming show that I am apart of is coming up in May, go to my projects page for more info about that! <p>
